      'We facilitate a deeper and richer, more open consultation with the communities cultural organisations work for.

Cultural organisations can add to this with new artist commissions or pick from the portfolio. This will allow artists and arts organisations to explore and test new ideas in new contexts and enable projects to be easily be picked up in different locations with different communities.',
    bodyAnswerSecond:
      'any voting event can apply vote weighting in a number of different scenarios. This means for example, that those closest to the issues can have their vote weighted to mean more overall. For instance local votes might be given more weight in an international selection process for a new public artwork.',

      'as an organisation with over 25 years of experience in creating digital and physical cultural experiences with communities, our expertise comes as part of the package.
